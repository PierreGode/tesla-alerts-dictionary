	This alert indicates that the ASW configuration took too long.<br><br>There is a mismatch between the state management configuration and the controllers. The current state stays in an initialized state (0xFF). It is configured in the STM, but it is not used by the controllers. The current states stay in the initialized state for a longer period of time without being used by the corresponding component.
