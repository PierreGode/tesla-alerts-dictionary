	<br>
	This alert is a load-shed request from Gateway (GTW) due to the voltage of the LV bus.&nbsp;<div><br><b>Set:&nbsp;</b>This alert is set when the GTW sends the CH_hvBatteryLow signal, which is a carry-over signal from Electronic Air Suspension (EAS). Despite the name of the alert, this message indicates to the air suspension controller that the LV system (not necessarily the LV battery or HV battery) is at a low voltage,&nbsp;and so it sends the controller into a limp mode to reduce the electrical loading on the LV system. It is likely to see this during a load-shed event where the LV system is not being properly supported by the DCDC.<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Clear:&nbsp;</b>Clearing of the low high-voltage battery signal (CH_hvBatteryLow).
