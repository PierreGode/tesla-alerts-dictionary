	This alert will trigger when the EPAS2 E-fuse output is faulted as seen by the E-fuse electronic control unit (ECU). This can occur if an unexpectedly high inrush current out of the EPAS2 feed or a short circuit event has occurred at the output of the E-fuse. Another possibility is that a long current event, which exceeds the current carrying capability of the cable, has occurred. Once the E-fuse is tripped (turned off), the EPAS1 will measure ~0V when it is loaded or ~9.8V when there is an open circuit.<div><br></div><div>The EPAS2 E-fuse output in Model X vehicles are responsible for all of the following loads.</div><div><ul><li>EPAS2 (secondary).</li><li>Falcon Doors.</li><li>2nd and 3rd row seats.</li><li>All other loads on the Auxiliary Fuse Box. </li></ul></div><div>For Model S vehicles, only EPAS2 is connected to this output.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Any short circuit or inrush condition on the above feeds may cause this E-fuse to trip. ?</div>
