	The port expanders on the front controller are inhibitted because there is voltage on the eFuse lockout circuit.<br>Voltage detected on the lockout circuit when the right controller hasn't reported that the lockout circuit is active.<br>When there is no longer voltage on the lockout circuit.<br>Many vehicle functions will not be operational, OTA's will fail.<br>The front vehicle controller has detected a problem with the power conversion system circuit.<br>The front louver is broken and should be replaced. HVAC cabin cooling (air conditioning) and powertrain performance may be limited.<br>Louver fails the calibration range check after 5 calibration cycles due to over-travel<br>Louver is able to calibrate and reach target.<br>The motor cannot reach the target RPM. HVAC cabin cooling (air conditioning) and powertrain performance may be limited<br>The motor RPM is incapable of reaching the target RPM for some time.<br>The motor RPM reaches its target.<br>The thermal fan will not run. HVAC cabin cooling (air conditioning) and powertrain performance may be limited. A reset will occur to attempt to clear the fault.<br>
