	Drive Inverter Warning: Stability control (VDC) is faulted<br>Stability control (also known as vehicle dynamics control or VDC) will fault if it does not receive all of its inputs or if the values of those inputs are implausible. This alert does not indicate cause, it was mostly likely set immediately after another DI alert that points to the specific cause of the fault.<br>This alert will clear on the drive cycle after the underlying fault cause has been corrected.<br>Stability control is not available. The vehicle should be driven with extreme caution.<br>
