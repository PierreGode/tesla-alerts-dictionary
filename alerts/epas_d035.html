	The difference of the measured steering rotor angle and calculated rotor angle is compared and integrated. The integrator has exceeded the threshold.<br><br>The deviation between the measured and calculated motor position angle is too big. The difference of the measured rotor angle and the rotor angle calculated is compared and integrated. When the integration value exceeds an applicable threshold (120 ï¿½ mech.), the error handler reports an error. In addition, the active and FOR the rotor speed must be &gt; 400rpm.
