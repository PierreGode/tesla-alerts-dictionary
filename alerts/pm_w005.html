	<p>A drive unit torque control problem was detected with the torque while in Neutral.</p><p><br></p><p>When the vehicle is in Neutral, no torque is commanded to the motor. The brake must be used when shifting out of Neutral and into Drive or Reverse. When Neutral is selected, the vehicle transitions into electrical neutral and commands zero torque to the motor by de-energizing the motor.</p>
