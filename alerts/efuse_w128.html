	This alert will trigger when the DCDC E-fuse output (input into the 12V system) is faulted as seen by the E-fuse electronic control unit (ECU).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This can occur if an unexpectedly high inrush current into the DCDC module or a short circuit event has occurred at the output of the E-fuse. Once the E-fuse is tripped (turned off), the Electronic Stability Program (ESP) Motor will measure ~0V when it is loaded or ~2V when there is an open circuit for the -D and -E 	Top Level Assemblies (TLAs). For -F and beyond TLAs, the open circuit voltage is 9.8V. ?</div>
