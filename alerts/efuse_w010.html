	<br>
	The external 12V supply voltage from the vehicle is out of range.&nbsp;<br><br>This alert sets when the measured voltage is detected to be below 7.31V, which indicates a power loss event. The alert is not set during an electronic control unit (ECU) reset. Once it is set, the alert is cleared when the voltage detected is above 7.31V. This alert is usually accompanied with other 12V alerts, indicating a generic 12V under voltage or sudden power loss.
