	This alert will raise when the Electronic Stability Program (ESP) Motor E-fuse output is faulted as seen by the E-fuse electronic control unit (ECU).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This can occur if an unexpectedly high inrush current into the ESP Motor module or a short circuit event has occurred at the output of the E-fuse. Another possibility is that a long current event, which exceeds the current carrying capability of the cable, has occurred. Once the E-fuse is tripped (turned off), the ESP Motor will measure ~0V when it is loaded or ~2V when there is an open circuit.?</div>
