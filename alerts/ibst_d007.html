	Checking the Watchdog status during the failsafe logic test fails due to an incorrect Watchdog status at the system Instrument Cluster (IC). During the failsafe logic test, the Watchdog status feedback from the system chip is tested against several patterns according to an ongoing sub-test. If the Watchdog status is not as expected, this alert is set.
