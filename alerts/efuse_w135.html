	<b>EFUSE_w135_condenserFanEFuseTrip</b>
	<br>
	This alert will trip on whenever the HVAC rail is turned <b>off. </b>This is expected and should be ignored, shall be fixed in future versions of firmware.<br><br>This alert will raise when the condenser fan channel is faulted as seen by the E-fuse electronic control unit (ECU). This can occur if an unexpectedly high inrush current into the condenser fan or a short circuit event has occurred at the condenser fan output of the E-fuse. Another possibility is that a long current event, which exceeds the current carrying capability of the cable, has occurred. Once the E-fuse is tripped (turned off), the output will measure ~0V.
