	The front vehicle controller fused high current circuit eFuse reported a current slope > 120A/ms.<br>The MCU Audio eFuse was retried because it false tripped due to inrush.<br>There is a >3% difference between VBAT_MONITORS's reported voltage and the AS8510 chip's reported voltage.<br>There is >3% difference between VBAT_MONITORS's reported voltage and the AS8510 chip's reported voltage.<br>There is <3% difference between VBAT_MONITORS's reported voltage and the AS8510 chip's reported voltage.<br>Improper treatment of the 12V battery, vehicle LV bus voltage could be higher or lower than is desired.<br>
