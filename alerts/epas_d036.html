	<br>
	Motor Driver: Comparison of Voltage Vector Angle failed.<br><br>The deviation between the voltage vectors of the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output and the Voltage phasor, which is using the synchronous generated voltage, phase current, and the Motor model, is calculated as too large. From the rotor voltage, the measured currents and the motor model is closed to the applied voltage at the motor terminal, and the willed applied terminal voltage (PWM) is compared to the angle level. In addition, FOR has to be active and the number of rotor revolutions &gt; 400 1 / min.
