	The front right rebound damping valve circuit is open, shorted, or returns an unexpected resistance. The damper valve is located on the damper body in the wheel well. Compression is the top valve, rebound is the bottom valve. The front damper valves are connected via pigtail harness from the front harness. The damper valves are driven by the Tesla Air Suspension ECU.<br><br><b>Set:&nbsp;</b>An open circuit, short circuit, or unexpected resistance value is detected on the valve after startup, or if the damper current deviates from the commanded current over time (indicating an unexpected circuit behavior).<br><b>Clear:&nbsp;</b>Drive rail cycle or ECU power cycle.<br><img src="./assets/7ce2ff20-0612-4c78-aa17-2d2b96cad52b.png"><br>
