	<b>BMS_f149_SW_precharge_too_short</b>
	<br>
	The Battery Management System (BMS) detected that the length of time it took the vehicle to precharge was too short. During the precharge sequence when the BMS is closing the contactors, the time it takes to reach target precharge voltage is too short. If the DC link voltage rise does not match a time constant with a 35% tolerance, then a precharge fault shall be asserted and precharge will be aborted.<div><div><br></div>The precharge being too short means that the voltage on the DC Link bus (vehicle side of contactors) rose faster than expected, similar to how if there was not enough capacitance on the bus.<br></div>
