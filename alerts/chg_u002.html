	<b>CHG_u002_LineImpedanceTooHigh</b>
	<br>
	The line impedance is too high, or the line voltage is dropping significantly from another source drawing current on the same circuit.<br><br>If this alert is present, the voltage, which is monitored continuously during charging, has dropped by 14% or more for a period longer than 1 second from the initial voltage sample value that was taken at the beginning of charge before current started flowing and the vehicle will not be able to charge.
