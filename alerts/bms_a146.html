	One or more bricks in the HV battery are at too low of a voltage to permit charging<br>BMS detected and recovered from bus off on VEH, HVS or HVI CAN bus<br>The BMS uses this for generic assertions about unexpected conditions<br>An Soc by Ah saturation of >3% occurred while SOC saturation was active<br>All bricks have <1% SOC by Ah saturation<br>BMS is likely overestimating SOC of some bricks due to incorrect CAC or Coulomb counting<br>BMS has detected that one or more bricks' voltage is below the warning threshold<br>
