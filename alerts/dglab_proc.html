	As soon as the PROC_RADX_XPLANTMODE routine is successfully run, A condition prevents successful CANRX (CAN message received) for the inertial signals message, relating to a checksum, a counter, or an out-of-bounds signal value.<br>The inertial signals message sent from the driver assistance system (DAS) Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to the radar controller (RADC) ECU is not as expected / as required for the radar to be enabled.<br>Received Chassis Type Does Not Match Learned Parameter<br>ECU internal fault - hardware controller error, replace sensor<br>ECU internal fault - RF Chip Fault,replace Sensor<br>Hardware / Software Interlock Error - the software programmed on the ECU does not match the hardware revision.<br>When the software programmed in not compatible with the hardware revision<br>As soon as the right software is programmed on the ECU<br>Sensor is disabled due to incompatibility and radar functions will not be available<br>ECU Internal fault - Memory Built in Self Test Disabled<br>The radar sensor is blocked, possibly due to environmental factors such as snow, ice, or dirt. There may also be something causing interference between the radar and the secondary surface (fascia), such as the harness being in front of the radar.<br>The radar has detected a blockage of its sensor / antenna.<br>
