	<b>BMS_u024_Not_Uncorked_Capable</b>
	<br>
	"Uncorking" 75D vehicles means a couple of things:<div><ul><li>Increasing the motor torque.</li><li>Increasing the maximum discharge current allowed for the high voltage (HV) battery.</li></ul><br>Some early 75kwh HV batteries were built with a shunt that had a hardware over current (HWOC) threshold which could trigger false HWOCs during a wide open throttle event due to ripple current that could cause the current to go over the uncorked current. In this case, the Battery Management System (BMS) will report the alert BMS_u024_Not_Uncorked_Capable? to let the customer and Service know that the vehicle is uncorked with a non-suitable HV battery. The current limit <b style="">will not</b> be increased, and the vehicle <b>will not</b> have uncorked performance.</div>
