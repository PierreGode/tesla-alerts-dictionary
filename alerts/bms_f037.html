	During the first two seconds of the contactors attempting to close, an issue with the positive contactor was detected.<br><br>If this alert is present, the contactors may be heard attempting to close but remain open as the issue is detected. The speed of the attempt to close and the re-opening may be too quick to distinguish between the two clicks.
