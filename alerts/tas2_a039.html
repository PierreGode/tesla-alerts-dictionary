	The alert checks for height sensor PWM faults every 10ms. A weighted counter increments by 10 for every faulted reading and triggers the fault at a threshold of 50.
<br><br><b>Set:
</b><br>The front right (FR) height sensor PWM signal has had a duty cycle <u>equal to 100%</u> for 50ms.
<br>A weighted counter increments by 10 for every FAULT_TYPE_PWM_OPEN_CIRCUIT and triggers the fault at a threshold of 50.<br><b><br></b><div><b>Clear:
</b><br>The front right (FR) height sensor PWM signal has had a duty cycle <u>less than 100%</u> for 500ms.
<br>A weighted counter decrements (from threshold of 50) by 1 for every valid reading and clears the fault when it reaches 0.</div>
