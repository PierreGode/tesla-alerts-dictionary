<p>The Gateway (GTW) is complaining about a state mismatch between the drive rail requested and the current one sensed.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em;">There are three scenarios that can cause this alert to appear:</span></p><p></p><ol><li>The Drive Rail was requested "On" by the Gateway, but it is stuck in the "Off" state. This is possibly due to a relay that will not unlatch.&nbsp;</li><li>The Drive Rail was requested "On" when it is already in the "On" state. This is most likely a bad sense lead in the Gateway.</li><li>The Drive Rail was requested "Off" and it is stuck in the "On" state. This is possibly due to a relay that will not unlatch?.</li></ol><p></p></div>
