	Pedal Monitor Warning: Stability Control Inhibited.<br>The safety monitor has detected that stability control is interfering adversely with driving ability. This shall be accompanied by other stability control alerts to aid diagnosis.<br>The safety monitor has disabled stability control. Customer facing alert that stability control is disabled. Regenerative braking and certain AP features are now disabled.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Accelerator Pedal Error.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when accelerator pedal sensor measurements are irrational or out of bounds.<br>This alert will clear when accelerator pedal sensor measurements are considered rational.<br>The safety monitor will initiate a limp condition for the remainder of the drive cycle.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Cruise remained on when commanded off.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when cruise control operation intepreted by the drive inverter is considered implausible.<br>The safety monitor may automatically cancel cruise control operation or potentially escalate to inhibiting torque production when detected.<br>Pedal Monitor  Warning: DIR CAN node MIA<br>PM is not receiving required feedback CAN messages from DIR<br>PM receives required feedback CAN messages from DIR<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: External Brake Torque Command is Invalid.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when sensor or other ECU inputs into EBR functionality are deemed implausible.<br>The safety monitor will disable external braking request (EBR) for the remainder of the drive cycle.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Torque Command does not match DI torque command.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Stator Temperature Sensor Error.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when stator temperature sensor measurements are irrational or out of bounds.<br>This alert will clear when stator temeperature sensor measurements are considered rational.<br>
