	Pedal Monitor Warning: Master/Slave Torque Sign is Inconsistent.<br>The safety monitor will disable innhibit torque production for the remainder of the drive cycle.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Accumulated Torque.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: iBooster (Brake Assist) node is MIA on CAN for one or multiple messages<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Inconsistent Autopark state.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when state follower behavior of the autopark feature is deemed implausible.<br>The safety monitor will disable the autopark feature for the remainder of the drive cycle.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Pre-watchdog expired.<br>This condition is set the watchdog GPIO pin is set, indicating an immediate watchdog reset is imminent. This alert is intended to collect diagnostic information only.<br>This alert will clear immediately.<br>This alert provides an imminent warning of a likely watchdog reset event.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: VCFRONT CAN node is missing.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when CAN communication from VCFRONT is considered irrational or missing.<br>VCFRONT is considered not communicating on CAN for remainder of drive cycle.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Torque Detected in non-torque producing gear.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: HVP CAN node MIA<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: PMF CAN node is missing.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when CAN communication from PMF is considered irrational or missing.<br>This alert will clear when PMF CAN data is received.<br>PM system is unable to determine PMF state.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Reset for unintended reason.<br>This condition is set when this ECU powers on and detects an abnormal reset condition from the previous power cycle (for example, from a watchdog timeout).<br>This alert will clear within one minute of setting.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: DAS CAN node is missing.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when CAN communication from DAS is considered irrational or missing.<br>DAS is considered not communicating on CAN for remainder of drive cycle.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: UI CAN node is missing.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when CAN communication from UI is considered irrational or missing.<br>UI is considered not communicating on CAN for remainder of drive cycle.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: PMR CAN node is missing.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when CAN communication from PMR is considered irrational or missing.<br>This alert will clear when PMR CAN data is received.<br>PM system is unable to determine PMR state.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Peripheral Register Configuration Error.<br>This condition is set when a the GPIO register of the ECU reports a configuration error, intended to be a diagnostic alert only.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: PM Gear Mismatch.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when gear stalk requests intepreted by the drive inverter are considered implausible.<br>The safety monitor may automatically shift gear to neutral or potentially escalate to inhibiting torque production when detected.<br>Pedal Monitor  Warning: DIF CAN node MIA<br>PM is not receiving required feedback CAN messages from DIF<br>PM receives required feedback CAN messages from DIF<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Stability Control causes unintended deceleration.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: PM and GTW config is Inconsistent.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when the drive inveter component configuration mismatches with the platform configuration.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: ECC Protection anamoly detected.<br>This condition is set when ECC protection detected a flash fetch or RAM read error, intended to be a diagonstic alert only.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: DI CAN node is missing.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when CAN communication from DI is considered irrational or missing.<br>DI is considered not communicating on CAN for remainder of drive cycle.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: GTW CAN node is missing.<br>The safety monitor sets this condition when CAN communication from GTW is considered irrational or missing.<br>GTW is considered not communicating on CAN for remainder of drive cycle.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Brake Pedal Error.<br>This condition sets when BLS NO and NC circuits are considered implausible.<br>This alert will clear when brake line switch (BLS) is considered plausible.<br>Pedal Monitor Warning: Cross Check Failed.<br>
