	<b>CHG_f125_leakageTestFailure</b>
	<br>
	This fault indicates that the voltage decay after the supercharger external isolation test has happened too quickly.<br><br>During supercharger startup, the supercharger will open the output contactors after performing the external isolation test at 300V. The vehicle then monitors the time it takes for the 300V to decay. If the decay time is sufficient, the start-up sequence proceeds.
The purpose of this test is to check the common mode isolation (DC+ to DC-) of the high voltage chain from the supercharger cabinet to the vehicle's fast charge contactors.
