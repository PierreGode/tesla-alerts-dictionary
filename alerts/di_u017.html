	<br>
	This alert indicates that the tire and wheel setup has changed from a square (equal diameter) set to a staggered (different diameters) set or vice-versa. For example, if 19" wheels are installed on a P85+, this alert will be triggered. Currently (2.2.140), it is not shown to the customer, but that may change when more data has been collected.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The alert contains information about what the fitment was changed to. The alert is not set if the module reasserts the same tire fitment or when the wear factors get reset to default for other reasons, such as EEPROM corruption, <i>etc.&nbsp;</i>The alert shall only be set once per key cycle. This is controlled by the tire detection algorithm, not the alert specific code. The silent user alert will not clear, with exception of a power cycle, meaning there is no clearing logic in the code.</div>
