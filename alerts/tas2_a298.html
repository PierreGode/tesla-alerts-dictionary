	<b>TAS2_a298_vinNotLearned</b>
	<br>
	Tesla Air Suspension 2 (TAS2) uses a VIN learn because the system learns the damper travel endstops to compensate for any differences between height calibrations and nonlinearity between vehicles. <br><br>A VIN has not been saved to the controller. Damping control will enter a backup state and endstop protection will not be active. This is expected for a new ECU that has just been installed into a vehicle, or on a vehicle where the ride height calibration has been cleared.<br><br><b>Set:&nbsp;</b>The VIN learned to the controller does not match the VIN received on a car area network (CAN).<br><br><b>Clear:&nbsp;</b>A VIN is saved by performing ride height calibration.<br>
