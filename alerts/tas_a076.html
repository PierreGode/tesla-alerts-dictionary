	Off board 5V switched supply is measured to be over 5.5V.<br>Front left air valve detected open circuit.<br>Front left air valve commanded on but no electrical current measured.<br>An issue is indicated from the NVRAM Manager.<br>Record not found, CRC mismatch, Version mismatch, Version upgrade.<br>Ride height calibration, target suspension level, crash status, or learned VIN may be lost. <br>Pressure sensor signal voltage too low; likely disconnected.<br>Pressure sensor signal received is too low.<br>Pressure sensor signal received is in range.<br>One or more CAN messages from DI are not being received by the ECU.<br>One or more CAN messages from DI are not being received by the ECU (missing, bad RX rate, or invalid checksum/counter).<br>Successful reception of all RXd CAN messages from DI.<br>Air suspension functionality may be reduced. Excessive leveling corrections may occur and system may not lower suspension at higher speeds.<br>No valid ride height sensor calibrations have been saved to the ECU.<br>Received ride height sensor calibration values are inside of allowable range.<br>Air suspension will only level upon manual requests. Auto leveling of suspension is disabled.<br>
