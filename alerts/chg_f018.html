	The charging process was interrupted by the complex programmable logic device (CPLD) due to a very sudden increase of line current above the limit threshold.<br><br>The alert may be falsely set due to extreme AC line voltage disturbances from other equipment.<br>
<br>The Gen 1 charger spec defines the alert as line peak over-current trip level shall be &lt;= 85A with a response time &lt; 1us.<br><br>The Gen 2 charger spec defines the alert as greater than 33A (tolerance of +/- 1.7A) per phase board.
