<p>The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) rail voltage does not match what the vehicle is expecting.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em;">There are three scenarios that can cause this alert to appear:</span></p><p></p><ol><li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42857;">The ACC rail was requested "On" by the Gateway, but it is stuck in the "Off" state. This is possibly due to a relay that will not unlatch.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42857;">The ACC rail was requested "On" when it is already in the "On" state. This is most likely a bad sense lead in the Gateway.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42857;">The ACC rail was requested "Off" and it is stuck in the "On" state. This is possibly due to a relay that will not unlatch?.</span></li></ol><p></p></div>
