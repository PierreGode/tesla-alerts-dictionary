	A brake pedal sensor problem detected.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This alert has been setting due to either the brake pedal switch not being installed properly or defective switches. The switch is a two part switch where one portion of the switch sends brake signals to the Gateway, electronic stability program (ESP) module, and the <b>rear</b> drive unit while the other brake signal is sent directly to the <b>rear</b> drive unit for regeneration purposes. When the brake signal at the <b>rear</b> drive unit is not the same as the signal at the ESP module, this alert is triggered.</div>
