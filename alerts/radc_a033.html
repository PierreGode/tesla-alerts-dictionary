	The radar sensor is cleared of any blockage.<br>Radar internal object Tracking Self Test Not Done - This indicates that the radar has not seen any objects after being powered on. This alert is set on startup.<br>A condition prevents successful CANRX (CAN message received) for the vehicle state message, relating to a checksum, a counter, or an out-of-bounds signal value.<br>The vehicle state message sent from the driver assistance system (DAS) Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to the radar controller (RADC) ECU is not as expected / as required for the radar to be enabled.<br>ECU Internal Critical Temperature<br>Sensor Hardware Interference - The extrapolated sensor range is below the required range threshold. Most likely by increased noise from another HF (high frequency) source<br>When the sensor detects interference from a HF source<br>As soon as the noise from the HF source has subsided.<br>Radar object detection is affected, radar might provide incorrect information for objects which will impact autopilot functionality.<br>Redundant Temperature Sensor Implausible<br>DAS_carConfig message was not received<br>
