	<br>
	The power steering can only be disabled due to the present of&nbsp; "E-fuse self-tests" upon vehicle wake-up. If either the Electric Power Assist Steering (EPAS) primary or EPAS secondary fault at wake-up, there will be no assistance from the start. Sleeping and waking the vehicle will force a re-test, which will pass the next time if the conditions that caused the initial failure are not present.
<div><br></div><div>If the failure occurred during the drive itself, it is less likely to be E-fuse related. Once driving is underway with a working EPAS, the E-fuse software state is locked out for safety reasons and only the hardware sensing can make it trip. Both the EPAS circuits would have needed to trip their E-fuse during the journey for this to be the case.?</div>
