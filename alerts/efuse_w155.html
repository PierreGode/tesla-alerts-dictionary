	The temperature sensor for the 12V battery is disconnected from the E-fuse and reporting open circuit on the harness.
This will result in a default voltage set-point being used for charging the 12V battery, which will not be optimized for the present temperature. As a result, it is likely the 12V battery life will be reduced.
