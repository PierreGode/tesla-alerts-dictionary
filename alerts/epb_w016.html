	<br>
	The half bridge diagnostic fault line latches for more than 10ms on the positive lead of the left motor. This alert indicates an over-temperature condition from the left positive half bridge.<div><br></div>This alert is expected when the vehicle is parked on very high slopes. If this is the case, no further action is required. However, if this alert is seen while parking on normal slopes, this likely indicates a problem with the electronic control unit (ECU).
