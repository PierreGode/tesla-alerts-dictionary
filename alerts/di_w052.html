	The Drive Inverter has detected an encoder noise that is consistent with the magnetic interference produced by a cracked rotor end ring. The interference from a cracked rotor gets worse over time. The intent of the alert is to catch bad rotors before the problem becomes severe enough to cause encoder faults.
