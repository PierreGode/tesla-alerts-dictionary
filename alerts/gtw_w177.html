	The 12V battery voltage has dropped below 10.5V for at least 5 seconds. If this alert is present, the 12V battery has likely become damaged through excessive discharge and should be replaced.&nbsp; The root cause of this damage should also be diagnosed and repaired to prevent future occurrences in the new battery.<div><br></div><div>The flooded batteries used on Model X vehicles are especially sensitive to deep discharge, which can result in failures developing weeks or months later even if the battery looks fine initially.</div>
