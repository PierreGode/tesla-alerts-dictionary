	The voltage on the lockout circuit is not at 5V when the right controller is commanding it on.<br>The voltage read on the lockout circuit when the right controller is reporting that the lockout circuit is active is not high enough.<br>When the lockout is de-asserted or voltage reaches >2.5V<br>There is a risk of eFuses toggling if the front controller is reset and NVRAM doesn't work as expected.<br>
