	This alert checks for twistSustainedAtSpeed faults every 100ms. Twist indicates that two diagonal corners are higher than the other two and the chassis is reporting a twisted state - as if one wheel was parked on a large block. At speed, twist should not be observed because no road surface can hold the vehicle in a twisted state while in motion.<div><br></div><div>Twist is calculated using the four corner heights: front right (FR), front left (FL), rear right (RR), and rear left (RL).<br><i>Twist = </i>| (FL+RR)-(FR+RL) |<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Set:&nbsp;</b>When vehicle speed is greater 10mph AND twist is greater than 20mm for 10 seconds.<br><b>Clear:&nbsp;</b>When vehicle speed is less than 10mph OR twist is less than 20mm.</div>
