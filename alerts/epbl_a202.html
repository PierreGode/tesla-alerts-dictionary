	EPB's brake HW config is not compatible remote EPB's brake HW config<br>Remote EPB is present and local EPB has learnt brake HW config but is not compatible with remote brake HW config<br>EPB's brake HW config is changed or remote EPB's brake HW config is changed so that they are compatible<br>Remote and local EPB brake HW config is incompatible, parking brake function may be degraded<br>One or more of the expected CAN messages from EPBL were not received.<br>A message the local ECU expects to receive from the EPBL ECU hasn't been received within the expected timeout or the drop rate is too high while the EPBL is CAN active. The ECU is considered CAN active when VCFRONT_vehGoToSleep is 0.<br>All messages the local ECU expects to receive from the EPBL ECU are being received or the EPBL ECU is CAN inactive.<br>Parking brake functionality may be missing.<br>Indicates there was an active connection to the universal measurement and calibration protocol state machine<br>Brake Disc Wipe algorithm is not running due to loss of input signal(s)<br>One or more of the expected CAN messages from PM were not received.<br>
