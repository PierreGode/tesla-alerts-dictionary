	The alert checks for height sensor PWM faults every 10ms. <br><br>A weighted counter increments by 10 for every <i>repeated</i> fault and triggers the fault at a threshold of 50.
 The weighted counter decrements by 1 for every valid reading and clears the fault when it reaches 0.<br><br>TAS2_a030_PWMerrorFL will trigger if any of the following faults are set:<br><br><b>PWM_OVER_MAX_DUTY</b><br><ul><li>Set:The height sensor PWM signal has had a duty cycle <u>greater than 87.5%</u> for 50ms.</li><li>Clear:The height sensor PWM signal has had a duty cycle <u>less than 87.5%</u> for 500ms.</li></ul><br><b>PWM_UNDER_MIN_DUTY
