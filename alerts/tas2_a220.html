	<b>TAS2_a220_exhaustGalleryFault</b>
	<br>
	The alert checks for exhaust gallery faults every 100ms. <br>
<b><br>Set:</b>
After an exhaust procedure, gallery pressure stays above 5 Bar.<br>
<b>Clear:
</b>After an exhaust procedure, gallery pressure decreases below 5 Bar.<br><br><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;An exhaust procedure is considered completed if one of the following is true:<div><ul><li>After opening the exhaust valve, gallery pressure has been constant within +/- 0.05 Bar for 50ms.</li><li>The exhaust valve has been open for more than 2.5 seconds.</li></ul>The gallery is the volume within the valve block that gets pressurized prior to filling the reservoir or an air spring. The gallery is where the pressure sensor measures pressure when other components open their valves to connect to the gallery. The gallery is exhausted to atmosphere after a filling or a pressure check operation to reduce stress on the system. This is done by closing all valves except the exhaust valve, allowing the gallery pressure to decrease. The decrease in gallery pressure is limited by an internal check valve in the compressor, which is rated above atmospheric pressure.<i></i></div>
