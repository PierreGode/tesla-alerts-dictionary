	This alert is triggered when the Autopilot Secondary does not receive a periodic message from the Autopilot Primary that sets the Drivers Assistance System (DAS) electronic control unit's (ECU) internal Ethernet switch to either allow or deny external network traffic. When connected with Toolbox to a Model S or X vehicle, the DAS ECU must allow traffic to pass to the media control unit (MCU) to enable communication with the vehicle.<br><br><div>There might be an internal communication issue between the Autopilot Secondary and the Autopilot Primary, or the Autopilot Primary is not running as expected.<br></div>
