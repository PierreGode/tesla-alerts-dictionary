	<br>
	Motor Driver: The Comparison of the Voltage Length Angle has failed.<br><br>The deviation between the voltage vectors of the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output and the Voltage phasor, which is using the synchronous generated voltage, phase current, and the Motor model, is calculated as too large. The length difference between the voltage vector (from which the Emf calculates the measured currents), the motor model, and the voltage vector extending through the terminal voltage (PWM) is too large. The FOR has to be active, the rotor speed less than 6000rpm, and ECU-Home must be passed 100ms.
