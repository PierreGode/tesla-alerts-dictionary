	<p>The customer has attempted to start the vehicle, and the media control unit (MCU) or instrument cluster (IC) is not fully up yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The alert is usually present when the IC is still booting after wake-up, but it can also appear if there are issues with the audio starting on the center display. This alert will prevent the drive rail from turning on for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, the vehicle will turn on the drive rail eventually, even without the IC or MCU being ready.</p>
