	If the contactors are trying to close and the Direct Current (DC) link voltage rise does not match a time constant with a 35% tolerance, then a precharge fault shall be asserted and precharge aborted. During the precharge sequence when the Battery Management System (BMS) is closing the contactors, the time it takes to reach target precharge voltage is too long.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><br></b><div><br></div>The precharge taking too long means that the voltage on the DC Link bus (vehicle side of contactors) rose slower than expected, similar to how if there was too much capacitance or resistance to chassis on the bus&nbsp;<br><p></p>
