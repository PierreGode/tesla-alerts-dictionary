	<b>VCFRONT_a220_reverseBatteryFault</b>
	<br>
	The reverse battery protection transistor is in its faulted state. This occurs when an abnormally high amount of current is detected flowing from the low voltage (LV) battery vehicle controller (VCFRONT or VCBATT) to the LV battery.<br>The low voltage (LV) battery vehicle controller (VCFRONT or VCBATT) has detected an issue with the reverse battery protection transistor.<br>The low voltage (LV) battery vehicle controller (VCFRONT or VCBATT) no longer detects an issue with the reverse battery protection transistor.<br>The low voltage (LV) electrical system for the vehicle could become unsupported and shut down if power conversion system (PCS) support is also lost<br>
