	<br>
	This alert was formerly named DIS_f147_overtorqueUnavailable in firmware versions prior to 2017.6 (17.6.15). If DIS_f147_overtorqueUnavailable appears on the vehicle or in the logs, update the vehicle firmware to the current version.<br><br>The algorithm behind this alert has evolved over time and may continue to evolve. While DIS_f147_overtorqueUnavailable actively limited torque levels to prevent Drive Unit malfunction, the new alert, DIS_f147_highTorqueWearLimit, reminds customers to take it easy but does not actively limit torque levels.
