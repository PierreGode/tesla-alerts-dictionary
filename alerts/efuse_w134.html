	This alert will raise when the iBooster channel is faulted as seen by the E-fuse electronic control unit (ECU).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This can occur if an unexpectedly high inrush current into the iBooster or a short circuit event has occurred at the iBooster output of the E-fuse. Another possibility is that a long current event, which exceeds the current carrying capability of the cable, has occurred. Once the E-fuse is tripped (turned off), the output will measure ~0V if it is loaded <b>or</b> ~?9.6-10.6V if there is an open circuit. </div>
