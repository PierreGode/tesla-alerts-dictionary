	<br>
	The Battery Management System (BMS) will trigger this alert when it senses a loss of contactor power while the contactors are closed. The BMS assumes that it could be because the pyro fuse on the contactor power supply signal blew during a crash.<br><br>This may trigger while a vehicle is in Service and the contactor power supply loop has been pulled.
