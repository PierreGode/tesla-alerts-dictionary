	This alert indicates there is a phase comparison error with the motor driver.<br><br>Upon detection of a phase short-circuit (either against each other or between the ground and UBATT), it is transferred to a safe state after 100ms. There is an interruption to the servomotor. This monitoring is active. The FOR and rotor speed must also be active for less than 500rpm, and the nominal current over an applicable value lie.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>If the conditions listed are satisfied and the actual current differs by more than 50% of the nominal current, the components' internal error filtering begins, which happens 100ms after reporting an error to the Error Handler. If it is within the error filter time (100ms) and the deviation is less than 50%, the components' internal back-filtering half-gradient of the error filtering is enabled.</div>
