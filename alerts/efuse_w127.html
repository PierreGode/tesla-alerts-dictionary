	This alert will trigger when the vbat-fused high current E-fuse upstream of the air compressor E-fuse <b>internal</b> to the E-fuse module is faulted as seen by the E-fuse electronic control unit (ECU).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This can occur if an unexpectedly high inrush current into the air compressor or a short circuit event has occurred at the air compressor output of the E-fuse. Another possibility is that a long current event, which exceeds the current carrying capability of the cable, has occurred. Once the E-fuse is tripped (turned off), the air compressor will measure ~0V.?</div>
