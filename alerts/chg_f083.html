	<b>CHG_f083_allPhasesFaulted</b>
	<br>
	This alert is set if all active phase boards have used up their retries and are in a faulted state. The cause is often exterior to the charger, and it is unlikely multiple phase boards break simultaneously. Events that impact multiple phase boards at once could be issues related to charge cables, input power, or faults on the high voltage (HV) rails.
