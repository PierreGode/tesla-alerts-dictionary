	Ride height sensors are measured to be in twisted or implausible state.<br>Implausible condition detected on rear right air valve circuit, possibly due to ECU hardware failure.<br>Implausible condition detected on front left air valve circuit.<br>Air compressor has reached its duty cycle (on time) limit.<br>Air compressor has dropped below its duty cycle (on time) limit, plus some hysteresis.<br>Air suspension leveling via the air compressor will be temporarily disabled until air compressor duty cycle drops.<br>Abnormal PWM signal received from front right PWM height sensor. More sensitive than other ride height sensor alerts.<br>Implausible condition detected on air compressor or air compressor relay circuit, possibly due to ECU hardware failure.<br>Implausible condition detected on front right air valve circuit.<br>Implausible condition detected on front right air valve circuit, possibly due to ECU hardware failure.<br>Air suspension system is operating under limp home mode 20 restrictions.<br>The ECU has detected an issue whose severity requires operating under limp home mode 20 restrictions.<br>
